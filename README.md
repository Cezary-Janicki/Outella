# Outella

Outella is a online product catalog for a clothes store. This is my main project through which I learn react, javascript and basic webdesing principles. 


## Features I'm curently working on 
- Fully implementing an online json database
- Implementing a wider use of queries to allow for greater filtering, and page linking options
- Improving the site both desktop and mobile layout as well as overall responsiveness 

## Already working on Outella
- Pages and routes are dynamically generated from a database
- Parts of the webpage are responsive, although webpage isn't suited for mobile use yet
- Product gallery has a simple filter implemented 
- Product page has a natual and swipeable image gallery
