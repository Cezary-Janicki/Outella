I want to add variable images to the image carousel in the product page just like in the main product gallery
In order to do this i need to pass both image link and how many slides should be displayed
Both number of pictures and picture link are stored in the md file, however the picture dirs will need to be changed for easier access

To load the into the file a map should be used that uses the stored picture count information and all of the pictures should be automaticaly imported using requireContext(example below)
To stop images from repeating we can overload the media const with images, and modulate how many slides we show in order for images not to repeat.
   (the image count value in md file that should be passed posts/products/[id].js as SLIDE_COUNT) â†‘
To do this all of the products would need to have the same generic import names dress1, dress2 ect.
